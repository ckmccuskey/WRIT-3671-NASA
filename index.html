<p>teacher and nanny turned mama and homemaker, i’m living life in the midwest with my best friend, raising our baby boy! i’ve spent my whole life in minnesota, and while we have hopes and dreams to someday move our little family closer to the sea, for now we are leaning into contentedness and loving our little suburban farm town home.</p>

<p>derek and i met during freshman year of college, and have been together ever since, getting married just three weeks after graduation. in addition to the typical newlywed struggles, our first year of marriage saw major unknown illness (mine), death of a parent (his), and loss of a job we were really counting on. a couple years of pinching pennies and frugal living later, we were able to buy our first house, then nearly one year to the day later had our baby boy, and i feel like i’m living a dream!</p>

<p>i first found myself interested in essential oils and natural products when looking for more natural approaches to overall health. tired of the bandaid approach to wellness our society loves, masking symptoms rather than addressing the cause, i was interested in something different that could help improve my health, especially with so many unknowns and unanswered questions about the symptoms i was having. after doing more research into the products i was using, i downloaded the thinkdirty app and found that so many of the popular brands of products i was putting on my body, in my hair, and cleaning my house and our clothes with, contained known carcinogens, hormone disrupters, allergens, and skin and respiratory irritants. yikes. without thinking about it, i was causing so many of these health issues in myself, and making my body work so much harder just to maintain itself.</p>

<p>i bought my starter kit as a gift to myself using christmas and birthday money, and immediately was added into a community that helped me understand what these little bottles of oil could do for me, as well as how to swap out those harmful products for healthier options. Now, rather than standing in target staring at the back of a bottle of shampoo, wondering what the ingredients mean, we order our household cleaner, vitamins and supplements, soap, toothpaste, haircare, facewash, laundry soap and so much more all from one place and can trust that it isn’t causing unknown harms!</p>

<p>sharing about these oils and products has come naturally from my love and passion for them, and has allowed me to not only stay home to raise my baby boy, but to dream big dreams about what we could do with the financial freedom from this business. someday soon we hope to be able to open our home to children in foster care, someday dreaming to build a huge home to love and care for the fatherless of our community.</p>

<p>i am so glad to have you here!</p>
