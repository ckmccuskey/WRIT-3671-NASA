  <font color= red><h3>Mission Objectives</h3></font>
  <p>During the final stages of preparation for Apollo 17, federal funding was cut from NASA’s lunar program.  Apollo 17 was a go, while the subsequent three launches were cancelled.  Being the final launch of the program, NASA’s remaining lunar goals would have to be completed to wrap up over a decade worth of lunar exploration.</p>
  <p>This final launch of the program included its first scientist in the crew.  The mission objectives were to conduct geological surveying, sampling, and surface experiments; and in-flight experiments and photographic tasks while in lunar orbit.</p>

        <p>As Apollo 17 was the final launch of the program, it was more symbolic of the program as a whole, rather than standing more so as a singular mission.  Therefore, the Greek god Apollo stands out in the foreground of the emblem in gleaming gold, as a representation of the Apollo Program.</p>

        <p>This emblem includes stars and stripes, once again representing the U.S. flag.  The three stars are a parallel to the three astronauts, and the stripes compose the wing of the eagle – another representation of the U.S.  With the ending of the Apollo Program, “the moon is partially overlaid by the eagle's wing suggesting that this is a celestial body that man has visited and in that sense conquered” (Kauderer, 2012).  Apollo, the symbol of the full program, and the eagle are right-facing towards another planet and a galaxy; looking on to what would soon become NASA’s next goals and missions.</p>

  <font color="red"><h5>Appeals</h5></font>
  <p></p>

  <h5>Ethos</h5>
  <p>By the time the Apollo 17 launch happened in the program timeline, the world knew NASA and the Apollo program.  Therefore, the ethos appeal was already, inherently, in the emblem.  It lies in the Apollo name and the astronauts’ names, and the fact that it is a product and symbol of NASA.</p>

  <h5>Logos</h5>
  <p>Visual representations of the entire Apollo Program, from the god Apollo to the moon, make up the bulk of this emblem.  They are factual visual representations of the program; however, they don’t visually show what this specific mission was aiming to achieve.</p>

  <h5>Pathos</h5>
  <p>This emblem provides a strong pathos appeal in the pride of achieving Apollo’s overarching program mission, and excitement in the golden age of space exploration to come.</p>

  <font color="red"><h5>Audience Effectiveness</h5></font>
  <p>The Apollo 17 emblem does cover each of the three appeals, however the logos appeal is centered more around the program as a whole rather than the mission itself.  Focusing on what NASA has achieved through the Apollo Program and looking towards NASA’s missions to come gives a strong appeal to pathos, but does not cover logos in a way directed towards this mission and its objectives.  Looking at it from the perspective of audience effectiveness, this missing portion from the visual representation takes away from the overall effectiveness of the emblem.</p>
