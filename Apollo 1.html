<p>Apollo 1 would be the first manned flight of the lunar program; the command module would launch, orbit the earth, and return.  Unfortunately, on January 27th, 1967, a fire swept through the command module during a preflight test on the launch pad, killing all 3 astronauts.</p>

      <p>The Apollo 1 mission emblem is surrounded by the United States flag.  While in the heat of the space race against the Soviet Union, it was important that NASA’s accomplishments were the accomplishments of an entire nation.  Backed by federal funding and the President’s words, the Apollo Program was brought to the forefront of society and history because it was truly the effort of the U.S. to achieve what no man had done and get ahead of the rest of the world.</p>

      <p>The next ring surrounding the detailed center image contains the names of the astronauts: White, Grissom, and Chaffee.  (10 out of 12 Apollo mission emblems included the astronauts’ names, with Apollo 11 and 13 being the outliers.)  It also holds the name of the mission: Apollo 1.  These details were important as this crew would be the one to carry out the mission that the U.S. and NASA were launching; at that time, the names of the men reaching space were just as well known as the country which they were representing.</p>

      <p>In the foreground of the center image, the command module is in orbit around the earth.  The mission objective was to complete a full orbit of the earth, as it would be the second of many steps in working towards achieving the ultimate goal of the program (the first step being a man traveling to space, which astronaut Alan Shepard achieved 6 years previously).  Therefore, the image is of the command module completing the Apollo 1 mission objective, and aiming towards the goal of the Apollo Program, with the moon lying in the visual path of the command module.</p>

<font color="red"><h5>Appeals</h5></font>
<p></p>

<h5>Ethos</h5>
<p>The emblem shows NASA’s intentions, and does so even through the detail of the launch site being in the image geographically. They are not hiding anything, from the beginning to the end of the mission.</p>

<h5>Logos</h5>
<p>The mission objective is visually laid out: to orbit the earth, completing the first step in eventually reaching the moon later in the program.  These facts of what NASA’s and the crew’s goals were and what the mission included display a clear tie to logos.</p>

<h5>Pathos</h5>
<p>Soviet cosmonaut Yuri Gagarin was the first man to orbit the earth, and through this mission and program overall, we were trying to catch up to and pass the Soviet Union in the space race.  This image of a U.S. command module orbiting the earth gives hope to the U.S. people of that happening.</p>

<font color="red"><h5>Audience Effectiveness</h5></font>
<p>Analyzing the effectiveness of how the emblem and its appeals translate to its target audience, it did well, but it could have been made more effective with a stronger appeal to logos.  Before this launch, the U.S. had already sent astronaut Alan Shepard to space, so the reason behind Apollo 1 was to complete a full orbit of the earth. This is an important distinction in “firsts” that you wouldn’t know from the emblem if you did not know the mission.</p>
