<font color= #D6A586><h2>what are essential oils?</h2></font>

<p><b>essential oils are a highly concentrated version of the natural oils in plants.</b>
they are obtained by a distilling process that involves every part of the plant, including roots, leaves, stems, flowers, and bark, resulting in an oil containing the fragrance and healing properties of the plant. you can think of the oil as a plant's immune system; it is the life-blood of the plant!
essential oils can provide support to every system of our bodies, including hormones, nervous system, and metabolism. it only takes 2 minutes for oil molecules to hit the bloodstream, and only 20 minutes to affect every cell in your body!
</p>

<font color= #D6A586><h2>what's so great about young living oils?</h2></font>
<p><b>young living has exacting quality standards, controlling the process from "seed to seal" to ensure every step is all-natural.</b>
there are actually essential oils in many of the products we use every day, such as toothpaste or cosmetics, but most of these oils have synthetic elements, and can be processed by your body as a toxin. young living oils are therapeutic-grade, because there is nothing but the pure essence of the plant in the bottle. young living guarantees their distillation process from "seed to seal" to guarantee that every drop of oil is beyond organic. learn more about the seed to seal process here!
<ul>
  <li>young living is the world leader in essential oils.</li>
  <li>they have been harvesting and distilling oils for over 20 years, and they own their own farms and distilleries across the globe.</li>
  <li>young living farms have never ever been touched by chemicals; they control pests with essential oils!</li>
  <li>young living essential oils do not have any additives and can be taken internally.</li>
</ul>
</p>

<font color= #D6A586><h2>if i buy a starter kit, do i have to sell oils?</h2></font>
<p>nope! as a wholesale member, you will never ever be pressured to sell or share about your oils. you can simply enjoy our oily community--facebook group, classes etc., and get your wholesale discount on all young living products.
however, if you are ever interested in starting your own business to sell young living products, our team will set you up for success with plenty of resources! we run a free, 3-week mentorship class every month so you can learn all about the business side, and decide if you'd like to join the team!
</p>

<font color= #D6A586><h2>are there any costs or renewal fees to be a wholesale member?</h2></font>
<p>the young living wholesale membership is included free with the purchase of a premium starter kit. once you are a wholesale member, you receive 24% off all purchases of young living products! there is no monthly fee to maintain membership, and no renewal fee. the only condition of maintaining membership is that you order at least 50pv (approx $50) of product per year, otherwise your membership would go on hold due to inactivity, and you would have to contact young living to reinstate it (but there would still be no renewal fee).
</p>

<font color= #D6A586><h2>what's the difference between doterra and young living?</h2></font>
<p>both companies make very high quality essential oils. young living however, has been in business longer (yl founded in 1993, and doterra in 2008), which not only means that young living has a better established track record of quality, but they also offer a much broader range of products. additionally, only young living is committed to quality and control from "seed to seal."
</p>

<font color= #D6A586><h2>what's the deal with rollers?</h2></font>
<p>rollers are a great way to apply oils topically. don't be intimidated, it's fun and easy to make your own rollers of all your favorite oil blends!
</p>

<font color= #D6A586><h2>how and why do you use a diffuser?</h2></font>
<p>diffusers are a super easy way to use oils aromatically for therapeutic use, and to make your house smell great!
</p>

<font color= #D6A586><h2>what's so great about the starter kit?</h2></font>
<p>everything! young living has specifically selected the most popular oils for a range of uses and bundles them together at half price! this makes it easy to get started and have everything you need.
</p>

<font color= #D6A586><h2>how long does a starter kit last?</h2></font>
<p>if you use your oils consistently, the kit will probably last around 6 months. this also depends on whether you dilute the oils or use them right out of the bottle. additionally, your favorite oils will probably get used up faster than others! however, the more you experiment with different oils, the more you will find uses for every one of them.
