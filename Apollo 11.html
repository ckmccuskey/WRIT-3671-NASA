  <font color= red><h3>Mission Objectives</h3></font>
  <p>Apollo 11 would accomplish the goal that President John F. Kennedy had announced to the nation 8 years prior: Armstrong, Aldrin, and Collins would perform a crewed lunar landing and return to earth, being the first men to reach the moon.   While on the moon, they would conduct scientific exploration and gather lunar samples to return to earth.</p>

          <p>The first thing to notice about the Apollo 11 emblem is the absence of crew names. The crew decided on this, because they would not have been the first to land on the moon if not for all the people that came before them in the program and administration. Crew member Michael Collins explained, “We wanted to keep our three names off it because we wanted the design to be representative of everyone who had worked toward a lunar landing, and there were thousands who could take a proprietary interest in it, yet who would never see their names woven into the fabric of a patch. Further, we wanted the design to be symbolic rather than explicit” (Baldwin, 2016).</p>

        <p>The Arabic numeral “11” was chosen over the Roman numeral “XI” or written English “eleven” for universal readability. Landing on the moon was not only a huge moment for the US, but rather a world-wide breakthrough.</p>

        <p>Another piece that is more universally read is the use of the bald eagle in representation of the U.S., rather than use of the U.S. flag.  It is a more symbolic, covert representation, rather than the blunt, overt representation which the flag would have provided.</p>
        <p>The olive branch symbolizes the National Aeronautics and Space Act’s declaration that, “activities in space should be devoted to peaceful purposes for the benefit of all mankind” (“National Aeronautics and Space Act of 1958”, 1958).  With the way that humans have historically taken claim over “new” land, this was an important surrounding ideal of the program, and very crucial part to incorporate into the design, when man was set to physically explore a new celestial body for the first time.</p>
        <p>In the initial emblem design, Bob Gilruth, the director of the Manned Spacecraft Center, “saw the eagle landing with its talons extended as too hostile and warlike. So, the olive branch was transferred from the eagle’s mouth to his talons, a less menacing position” (Baldwin, 2016).</p>

  <font color="red"><h5>Appeals</h5></font>
  <p></p>

  <h5>Ethos</h5>
  <p>The image of the eagle landing on the moon with the olive branch is a strong representation of the values and intentions of NASA.  It is a clear appeal to ethos through both the credibility of the NASA program and the ethics which they employed.</p>

  <h5>Logos</h5>
  <p>The emblem contains images depicting the exact nature of the mission, which is a replication of logos in visual form.</p>

  <h5>Pathos</h5>
  <p>The Apollo 11 emblem became one of the most widely known and recognized NASA emblems, remaining so today.  Achieving such a feat not only for the U.S., but for the world, there are strong emotional ties to the mission which were done justice through this emblem.  The pathos appeals include hope in man reaching the moon, as the eagle shows, and victory in that achievement.</p>

  <font color="red"><h5>Audience Effectiveness</h5></font>
  <p>The Apollo 11 emblem successfully covers each appeal and is therefore extremely effective for its intended audience.  Armstrong, Collins, and Aldrin knew that what they were going to do would be known around the world, and they took extreme care in designing the emblem so that it could be interpreted and understood by everyone.</p>
