<h4>i am so thrilled you are ready to jump in!
ok, let‚Äôs do this!</h4>
<p>by signing up through me, you will become a part of my oily team, which is full of all the recipes, ideas, inspo, & community to help you get comfortable using your oils! we have private facebook group where we hang out & chat about all the oily things, so it‚Äôs a safe place to learn. you‚Äôll be able to connect with thousands of other oilers who can answer your questions & help you out along the way!</p>
<p><b>after you order your kit, you will receive a welcome email from me to plug you into all this goodness, as well as:</b></p>
<p>+ a helpful walk through your starter kit</p>
<p>+ happy mail at your doorstep (from me!) with my favorite blend, samples, ideas on how to use everything, and some extra fun surprises!</p>
<p>+ your personal referral link that you can pass along to your friends when they want oils too (happens all the time & you can get $50 from yl each time someone uses your link to snag their kit)!</p>
<hr></hr>

<p>follow these step-by-step ordering instructions to get your kit:</p>
<p>1.</p>
<p>+click this link: http://bit.ly/magsberggoils</p>
<p>2.</p>
<p>+select the member box and hit continue.</p>
<p>you should see my name pop up in the box!</p>

<p>3.</p>
<p>+the premium starter kit will already be selected for $165, but you get to choose your diffuser. the cost varies based on which one you pick--the desert mist is gorgeous, runs for up to 10 hours, and has a flicker option!! it's included in the $165 price--but if you want to get fancy you can upgrade to the aria (which is beautiful).</p>

<p>+before your life is forever changed in the best way- let me make it even sweeter. essential rewards also know as er. er is basically like a holistic amazon! er is how my family is switching and ditching all our chemical and toxic products in our home. (download the free app called thinkdirty to scan your products!) er is by far my favorite part of young living, (and how i get to try so many free oils) some people feel like they do not have the "extra" money to do this. i would encourage you to write down all the products you use every month. you will be surprised that most likely, you are already spending that on chemical-filled products and you can now buy healthy, safe, immune building products with young living such as toothpaste, shampoo, conditioner, body wash, bar soap, makeup, mouthwash, cleaning supplies, kids products, pet products- the list is a mile long-- young living has it all. you also get 10% back on everything, at month four‚Äîthat gets bumped up to 20% and eventually‚Äî25% back! i love target but they don‚Äôt do that for me ü§™</p>
<p>+to hop on‚Äî hit yes when it asks ‚Äúwould you like to enroll in essential rewards and earn free products?‚Äù it will then ask you ‚Äúdo you want to use your premium starter kit (psk) as your first essential rewards (er) order? there are perks to using your psk as your first er order: you‚Äôll automatically meet the order requirements to enroll in essential rewards.‚Äù choose yes!</p>
<p>+your premium starter kit counts as your first month er order so no additional money needs to be spent up front.</p>
<p>when you hop on er, you‚Äôll get some extra loving‚Äî 10 points back in yl store credit to use the following month (points = free $), plus, an extra freebie from young living!</p>
<p>+er is never a requirement (unless you are using this as a business), you could pass, or also wait and do it later if you‚Äôd like, but it‚Äôs best to hop on now. because ya know-- dealzzz. **keep in mind that er is a monthly order, but you customize it each month, and you can cancel at any time with no penalties (except you won‚Äôt want to bc you‚Äôll be getting all the freebie oils, and you‚Äôll be stalking your postman for your box of wellness each month!!)</p>

<p>5.</p>
<p>+your kit will count for this month's er order! on this step, you will set up your order for next month‚Äî keep in mind you can change it after enrolling and will not be charged until it processes next month! if you need ideas, i share my favorites <font color= "#D6A586"><a href="favorite products.html">here</a></font></p>

<p>6.</p>
<p>fill out your info & continue</p>
<p>7.</p>
<p>next, you'll add shipping and payment info to complete checkout</p>
<p>8.</p>
<p>do a happy dance because your kit is coming & it‚Äôs going to be the happiest day when it shows up at your doorstep!!!</p>
<p>+i‚Äôll get an email when you order, and i‚Äôll send you some recipes and ideas for when it all arrives!</p>
